  Solar sensor device that implements the following:

   - read temperature, humidity, pressure and geiger counter sensors
   - read thermocouple temperature
   - read and set alarms in the real time clock
   - log sensor data on a microSD card
   - control room heating or cooling via RF power switches
   - use a communication protocol to send data to a PC

  there are 4 components in this repository:
  firmware_arduino  - contains the Arduino source code (avr version)
  firmware_avr      - stand-alone source code (avr version)
  hardware_avr      - open source hardware for the main board (avr version)
  server            - server-side implementation of the comm protocol

  Hardware needed:

  SHT15 Humidity and Temperature Sensor  - sparkfun sku: SEN-08257
  Grove - Geiger Counter - seeed studio sku: SEN63024P
  3W Solar Panel  - seeed studio sku: POW92136O

  main board that includes the LiPo charger, DS3231 to wake up the system, 
    5v boost, one logic level converter, 3.3v stabilized sources, atmega328p uC, 
    uSD card socket, xbee socket, digital cold junction compensated K-type 
    thermocouple IC and mosfets to power off unused modules.


  How does it work

    Power: the main power is from a 2Ah LiPo cell that is charged from the solar panel. a stabilization circuit and a boost give out 3.3V and 5V respectively. a small coin cell battery keeps the DS3231 RTC chip working at all times. the RTC's alarm function is waking up the microcontroller once every 30 minutes.

    Sensors: some are internal and some kept outside. The outside temperature and humidity are measured by a SHT15 chip. the Geiger-Muller tube is also kept outside. the internal temperature is read from the RTC chip, or via a K-type thermocouple.

    Sensor data: is saved to a uSD card and if the receiving PC is up and if the wireless signal haven't got too much interference than a protocol is used to send new data to the PC. it ends up here: http://www.simplex.ro/ro/statie_meteo.html

    Commands: are being given either via the wireless serial interface or via a universal remote control that can speak RC5 (most remotes can).
